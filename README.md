Crash Rate Analysis of Denver Streets: Project for Traffic Safety Improvement

This project examines traffic crash data from Denver streets to prioritize road safety improvements. Utilizing statistical analysis techniques such as ANOVA, Welch's t-tests, and regression methods, the study reveals significant differences in crash rates between different street tiers. Visualization through Power BI further highlights high-risk areas requiring immediate intervention. Recommendations are provided based on the findings, along with suggestions for expanding future analyses.
